# Gas Optimization 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Next, install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dolazdev/gas_challenge/
cd gas_challenge && npm install
```

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the necessary dependencies, open the `contracts/gasChallenge.sol` file to view the smart contract and apply the following gas optimization techniques above.

## Test Smart Contract

Next, head over to `test/test_gasChallenge.js`. You are required to write a unit test under the describe block to check that after running the gas optimized function, the sum of array is 0. Once you have implemented the test block, proceed the run the following command to test your smart contract.

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
